<h1><p>Tonkatsu pork cutlets are one of the many yoshoku, or western-style foods<br>that were originally introduced to Japan by Europeans. Like most other<br>yoshoku foods, the Japanese took the original tonkatsu and made it their own.</p></h1>
<h2><p>Today, tonkatsu is made by coating pork chops in crisp panko breadcrumbs<br>and deep-frying them until they are golden brown in colour. They are<br>normally served drizzled in fruit-and-vegetable based tonkatsu sauce with<br>shredded cabbage and other crisp salad greens on the side. Tonkatsu are<br>also often enjoyed as part of a bento boxed lunch, in a Japanese curry (known<br>as ’katsu curry’), or as a sandwich filling</p></h2>

<h3><p>Pork katsuretsu (cutlet) was invented in Japan in 1899 at a Tokyo restaurant called Rengatei.<br>Originally considered a type of yōshoku (a Japanese version of European cuisine) the dish was called katsuretsu or simply katsu.<br>The term “tonkatsu” (pork katsu) was adopted in the 1930s.</p></h3>

<h4><p>Tonkatsu is said to be inspired by the French dish, côtelette de veau, which is essentially breaded veal cutlet pan-fried in butter.<br> One Tokyo restaurant called Rengatei 煉瓦亭 (still open today!) took this concept and made <br>a few changes to appeal to the Japanese palette, and in 1899, Tonkatsu made its debut.</p></h4>
